# Stock-Price-Trend-direction-prediction

This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict the direction of stock prices for 25 companies listed on the FTSE 100 index of the London Stock Exchange. Using five years of historical data, the models are trained to forecast stock price movements over short, medium, and long-term periods. The goal is to provide accurate predictions that can inform trading strategies and investment decisions.
